----
# Work-Arounds

1. Rebase branches to collapse all commits before merging (and
   sacrifice ease-of-use).
2. Enforce better commit messages which incorporate the
   conversations from the review process.


# Fixing the "Problem"

1. Improve Git to allow branch-based bisecting.
2. Improve the ability to customise the default commit message (to add
   a template).
